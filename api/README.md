## GROQ Queries

Add `| order(name asc, description asc)` or some variation of this for ordering. This should be added right before the first opening curly bracket.

```
*[] | order(name asc, description asc) {
  ...
}
```

You can also slice for pagination using the `0...10` syntax (10 is an example, you can grab more or less than this if desired). Make sure to sort if this is the case!

```
*[0...5] {
  ...
}
```

### Sales

```
*[_type == "sale"][]{
  ...,
  "logo": logo.asset->url
}
```

### Products By Sale

```
*[_type == "product" && sale->_id == 'MY_ID'][] {
  ...,
  "images": images[].asset->url
}
```

### Products By Category

```
*[_type == "product" && "TAG" in tags[].value][] {
  ...,
  "images": images[].asset->url
}
```

### Products By Search

```
*[_type == "product" && [name, description] match "*SEARCH*"][] {
  ...,
  "images": images[].asset->url
}
```

### All Product Tags

This is not distinct! Make sure to filter first.

```
*[_type == "product" && count(tags) > 0].tags[]
```
